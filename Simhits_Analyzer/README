The analyzer is: plugins/Simhits_Analyzer.cc
--> It currently processes Simhits from EB, ES and EE.
--> Stores a variety of histograms in the output root file

The python cfg used to run, with cmsRun, using any step 1 input file(ddd OR dd4hep) is: test/Test_SimHits_cfg.py
--> Change the path to the "PoolSource" to the absolute path of a Step 1 file 


RUN:
-- Either stick the folder in a CMSSW release and cmsRun with the python cfg
OR
-- Copy out the cc file and cfg file into the plugins and test(or wherever) folders respectively of
an existing mkedanlzr setup.
